       " Document(page_content='# NautilusTrader Documentation\\n\\nWelcome to the official documentation for NautilusTrader!\\n\\nNautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,\\nproviding quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies\\non historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.\\n\\nThe platform is \\'AI-first\\', designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant \\nand robust Python native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest \\nenvironment, consistent with the production live trading environment.\\n\\nNautilusTraders design, architecture and implementation philosophy holds software correctness and safety at the\\nhighest level, with the aim of supporting Python native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting\\nand live deployment workloads.\\n\\nThe platform is also universal and asset class agnostic - with any REST, WebSocket or FIX API able to be integrated via modular\\nadapters. Thus, it can handle high-frequency trading operations for any asset classes\\nincluding FX, Equities, Futures, Options, CFDs, Crypto and Betting - across multiple venues simultaneously.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- **Fast:** C-level speed through Rust and Cython. Asynchronous networking with [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)\\n- **Reliable:** Type safety through Rust and Cython. Redis backed performant state persistence\\n- **Flexible:** OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, Windows. Deploy using Docker\\n- **Integrated:** Modular adapters mean any REST, WebSocket, or FIX API can be integrated\\n- **Advanced:** Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTD`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency order lists including `OCO`, `OTO`\\n- **Backtesting:** Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution\\n- **Live:** Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments\\n- **Multi-venue:** Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market making and statistical arbitrage strategies\\n- **AI Agent Training:** Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES)\\n\\n![Nautilus](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/docs/_images/nautilus-art.png?raw=true \"nautilus\")\\n> *nautilus - from ancient Greek \\'sailor\\' and naus \\'ship\\'.*\\n>\\n> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.\\n> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*\\n\\n## Why NautilusTrader?\\n\\n- **Highly performant event-driven Python** - native binary core components\\n- **Parity between backtesting and live trading** - identical strategy code\\n- **Reduced operational risk** - risk management functionality, logical correctness and type safety\\n- **Highly extendable** - message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters\\n\\nTraditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python (or other suitable language)\\nusing vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-drive way\\nusing C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot\\nexpress the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have\\nproven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\index.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform\\nhave all been written entirely in Rust or Cython. This means we\\'re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries, \\nwith CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.\\n\\n## Why Python?\\n\\nPython was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straight\\nforward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented\\nprogramming language. Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.\\nNot only that, Python has become the _de facto lingua franca_ of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nThe language out of the box is not without its drawbacks however, especially in the context of\\nimplementing large performance-critical systems. Cython has addressed a lot of these issues, offering all the advantages\\nof a statically typed language, embedded into Pythons rich ecosystem of software libraries and\\ndeveloper/user communities.\\n\\n## What is Cython?\\n\\n[Cython](https://cython.org) is a compiled programming language that aims to be a superset of the Python programming\\nlanguage, designed to give C-like performance with code that is written mostly in Python with\\noptional additional C-inspired syntax.\\n\\nThe project heavily utilizes Cython to provide static type safety and increased performance\\nfor Python through [C extension modules](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html). The vast majority of the production code is actually\\nwritten in Cython, however the libraries can be accessed from both Python and Cython.\\n\\n## What is Rust?\\n\\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe\\nconcurrency. Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no runtime or\\ngarbage collector. It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily\\nintegrates with other languages.\\n\\nRust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —\\neliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.\\n\\nThe project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python language binding is handled through\\nCython, with static libraries linked at compile-time before the wheel binaries are packaged, so a user\\ndoes not need to have Rust installed to run NautilusTrader. In the future as more Rust code is introduced,\\n[PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/latest) will be leveraged for easier Python bindings.\\n\\n## Architecture Quality Attributes\\n\\n- Reliability\\n- Performance\\n- Modularity\\n- Testability\\n- Maintainability\\n- Deployability\\n\\n![Architecture](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/docs/_images/architecture-overview.png?raw=true \"architecture\")\\n\\n```{eval-rst}\\n.. toctree::\\n   :maxdepth: 1\\n   :glob:\\n   :titlesonly:\\n   :hidden:\\n\\n   getting_started/index.md\\n   concepts/index.md\\n   guides/index.md\\n   integrations/index.md\\n   api_reference/index.md\\n   developer_guide/index.md\\n```', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\index.md'}),\n",

The\\nbelow is a list of some of the most important quality attributes which are considered\\nwhen making design and architectural decisions, roughly in order of \\'weighting\\'.\\n\\n- Reliability\\n- Performance\\n- Modularity\\n- Testability\\n- Maintainability\\n- Deployability\\n\\n## System architecture\\n\\nThe NautilusTrader codebase is actually both a framework for composing trading\\nsystems, and a set of default system implementations which can operate in various \\nenvironment contexts.\\n\\n```{note}\\nThroughout the documentation, the term _\"Nautilus system boundary\"_ refers to operations within\\nthe runtime of a single Nautilus node (also known as a trader instance).\\n```\\n\\n### Environment contexts\\n- `Backtest` - Historical data with simulated venues\\n- `Sandbox` - Real-time data with simulated venues\\n- `Live` - Real-time data with live venues (paper trading or real accounts)\\n\\n### Common core\\nThe platform has been designed to share as much common code between backtest, sandbox and live trading systems as possible. \\nThis is formalized in the `system` subpackage, where you will find the `NautilusKernel` class, \\nproviding a common core system \\'kernel\\'.\\n\\nA _ports and adapters_ architectural style allows modular components to be \\'plugged into\\' the\\ncore system, providing many hooks for user defined / custom component implementations.\\n\\n### Messaging\\nTo facilitate modularity and loose coupling, an extremely efficient `MessageBus` passes messages (data, commands and events) between components.\\n\\nFrom a high level architectural view, it\\'s important to understand that the platform has been designed to run efficiently \\non a single thread, for both backtesting and live trading. Much research and testing\\nresulted in arriving at this design, as it was found the overhead of context switching between threads\\ndidn\\'t actually result in improved performance.\\n\\nWhen considering the logic of how your trading will work within the system boundary, you can expect each component to consume messages\\nin a predictable synchronous way (_similar_ to the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)).\\n\\n```{note}\\nOf interest is the LMAX exchange architecture, which achieves award winning performance running on\\na single thread. You can read about their _disruptor_ pattern based architecture in [this interesting article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html) by Martin Fowler.\\n```\\n\\n## Framework organization\\nThe codebase is organized with a layering of abstraction levels, and generally\\ngrouped into logical subpackages of cohesive concepts.

The algorithm receives a primary order representing the total size and direction\\nthen splits this by spawning smaller child orders, which are then executed at regular intervals\\nthroughout the time horizon.\\n\\nThis helps to reduce the impact of the full size of the primary order on the market, by\\nminimizing the concentration of trade size at any given time.\\n\\nThe algorithm will immediately submit the first order, with the final order submitted being the\\nprimary order at the end of the horizon period.\\n\\nUsing the TWAP algorithm as an example (found in ``/examples/algorithms/twap.py``), this example \\ndemonstrates how to initialize and register a TWAP execution algorithm directly with a \\n`BacktestEngine` (assuming an engine is already initialized):\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.examples.strategies.ema_cross_twap import EMACrossTWAP\\nfrom nautilus_trader.examples.strategies.ema_cross_twap import EMACrossTWAPConfig\\n\\n# Instantiate and add your execution algorithm\\nexec_algorithm = TWAPExecAlgorithm()\\nengine.add_exec_algorithm(exec_algorithm)\\n```\\n\\nFor this particular algorithm, two parameters must be specified: \\n- `horizon_secs` \\n- `interval_secs` \\n\\nThe `horizon_secs` parameter determines the time period over which the algorithm will execute, while \\nthe `interval_secs` parameter sets the time between individual order executions.

This allows traders to define certain conditions and instructions for\\norder execution and management, which allows essentially any type of trading strategy to be created.\\n\\n## Overview\\nThe two main types of orders are _Market_ orders and _Limit_ orders.

The following is a brief\\nsummary of the different execution instructions available.\\n\\n### Time In Force\\nThe orders time in force is an instruction to specify how long the order will remain open\\nor active, before any remaining quantity is canceled.\\n\\n- `GTC` (Good 'til Canceled) - The order remains in force until canceled by the trader or the exchange\\n- `IOC` (Immediate or Cancel / Fill **and** Kill) - The order will execute immediately with any portion of the order quantity which cannot be executed being canceled\\n- `FOK` (Fill **or** Kill) - The order will execute immediately, and in full, or not at all\\n- `GTD` (Good 'til Date) - The order remains in force until reaching the specified expiration date and time\\n- `DAY` (Good for session/day) - The order remains in force until the end of the current trading session\\n- `AT_THE_OPEN` (OPG) - The order is only in force at the trading session open\\n- `AT_THE_CLOSE` - The order is only in force at the trading session close\\n\\n### Expire Time\\nThis instruction is to be used in conjunction with the `GTD` time in force to specify the time\\nat which the order will expire and be removed from the exchanges order book (or order management system).\\n\\n### Post Only\\nAn order which is marked as `post_only` will only ever participate in providing liquidity to the \\nlimit order book, and never initiating a trade which takes liquidity as an aggressor. This option is\\nimportant for market makers, or traders seeking to restrict the order to a liquidity _maker_ fee tier.\\n\\n### Reduce Only\\nAn order which is set as `reduce_only` will only ever reduce an existing position on an instrument, and\\nnever open a new position (if already flat). The exact behaviour of this instruction can vary between\\nexchanges, however the behaviour as per the Nautilus `SimulatedExchange` is typical of a live exchange.\\n\\n- Order will be cancelled if the associated position is closed (becomes flat)\\n- Order quantity will be reduced as the associated positions size reduces\", metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\concepts\\\\orders.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"- Order will be cancelled if the associated position is closed (becomes flat)\\n- Order quantity will be reduced as the associated positions size reduces\\n\\n### Display Quantity\\nThe `display_qty` specifies the portion of a _Limit_ order which is displayed on the limit order book.\\nThese are also known as iceberg orders as there is a visible portion to be displayed, with more quantity which is hidden. \\nSpecifying a display quantity of zero is also equivalent to setting an order as `hidden`.\\n\\n### Trigger Type\\nAlso known as [trigger method](https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/tws/usersguidebook/configuretws/modify_the_stop_trigger_method.htm) \\nwhich is applicable to conditional trigger orders, specifying the method of triggering the stop price.\\n\\n- `DEFAULT` - The default trigger type for the exchange (typically `LAST` or `BID_ASK`)\\n- `LAST` - The trigger price will be based on the last traded price\\n- `BID_ASK` - The trigger price will be based on the `BID` for buy orders and `ASK` for sell orders\\n- `DOUBLE_LAST` - The trigger price will be based on the last two consecutive `LAST` prices\\n- `DOUBLE_BID_ASK` - The trigger price will be based on the last two consecutive `BID` or `ASK` prices as applicable\\n- `LAST_OR_BID_ASK` - The trigger price will be based on the `LAST` or `BID`/`ASK`\\n- `MID_POINT` - The trigger price will be based on the mid-point between the `BID` and `ASK`\\n- `MARK` - The trigger price will be based on the exchanges mark price for the instrument\\n- `INDEX` - The trigger price will be based on the exchanges index price for the instrument\\n\\n### Trigger Offset Type\\nApplicable to conditional trailing-stop trigger orders, specifies the method of triggering modification\\nof the stop price based on the offset from the 'market' (bid, ask or last price as applicable).\\n\\n- `DEFAULT` - The default offset type for the exchange (typically `PRICE`)\\n- `PRICE` - The offset is based on a price difference\\n- `BASIS_POINTS` - The offset is based on a price percentage difference expressed in basis points (100bp = 1%)\\n- `TICKS` - The offset is based on a number of ticks\\n- `PRICE_TIER` - The offset is based on an exchange specific price tier\\n\\n### Contingency Orders\\nMore advanced relationships can be specified between orders such as assigning child order(s) which will only\\ntrigger when the parent order is activated or filled, or linking orders together which will cancel or reduce in quantity\\ncontingent on each other. More documentation for these options can be found in the [advanced order guide](advanced/advanced_orders.md).\\n\\n## Order Factory\\nThe easiest way to create new orders is by using the built-in `OrderFactory`, which is\\nautomatically attached to every `Strategy` class.

Defining a trading strategy is achieved by inheriting the `Strategy` class, \\nand implementing the methods required by the strategy.\\n\\nUsing the basic building blocks of data ingest, event handling, and order management (which we will discuss\\nbelow), it\\'s possible to implement any type of trading strategy including directional, momentum, re-balancing,\\npairs, market making etc.\\n\\nRefer to the `Strategy` in the [API Reference](../api_reference/trading.md) for a complete description\\nof all the possible functionality.\\n\\nThere are two main parts of a Nautilus trading strategy:\\n- The strategy implementation itself, defined by inheriting the `Strategy` class\\n- The _optional_ strategy configuration, defined by inheriting the `StrategyConfig` class\\n\\n```{note}\\nOnce a strategy is defined, the same source can be used for backtesting and live trading.\\n```\\n\\n## Implementation\\nSince a trading strategy is a class which inherits from `Strategy`, you must define\\na constructor where you can handle initialization. Minimally the base/super class needs to be initialized:\\n\\n```python\\nclass MyStrategy(Strategy):\\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\\n        super().__init__()  # <-- the super class must be called to initialize the strategy\\n```\\n\\n## Configuration\\nThe main purpose of a separate configuration class is to provide total flexibility\\nover where and how a trading strategy can be instantiated.

However, if you would like to run distributed backtests or launch\\nlive trading servers remotely, then you will need to define a configuration.\\n\\nHere is an example configuration:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom decimal import Decimal\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import StrategyConfig\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.identifiers import InstrumentId\\nfrom nautilus_trader.trading.strategy import Strategy\\n\\n\\nclass MyStrategyConfig(StrategyConfig):\\n    instrument_id: str\\n    bar_type: str\\n    fast_ema_period: int = 10\\n    slow_ema_period: int = 20\\n    trade_size: Decimal\\n    order_id_tag: str\\n\\n# Here we simply add an instrument ID as a string, to \\n# parameterize the instrument the strategy will trade.\\n\\nclass MyStrategy(Strategy):\\n    def __init__(self, config: MyStrategyConfig) -> None:\\n        super().__init__(config)\\n\\n        # Configuration\\n        self.instrument_id = InstrumentId.from_str(config.instrument_id)\\n\\n\\n# Once a configuration is defined and instantiated, we can pass this to our \\n# trading strategy to initialize.\\n\\nconfig = MyStrategyConfig(\\n    instrument_id=\"ETHUSDT-PERP.BINANCE\",\\n    bar_type=\"ETHUSDT-PERP.BINANCE-1000-TICK[LAST]-INTERNAL\",\\n    trade_size=Decimal(1),\\n    order_id_tag=\"001\",\\n)\\n\\nstrategy = MyStrategy(config=config)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```{note}\\nEven though it often makes sense to define a strategy which will trade a single\\ninstrument.

The execution of either \\norder triggers an attempt to cancel the other unexecuted order. Partial executions will also trigger an attempt to cancel the other order.\\n\\n### One Updates the Other (OUO)\\nAn OUO order is an order whose execution results in the immediate reduction of quantity in another \\norder linked to it.

This is typically done by placing a parent order \\n(also known as the entry order) and two child orders: a take-profit `LIMIT` order and a stop-loss `STOP_MARKET` order. \\nWhen the parent order is executed, the two child orders are also placed in the market. \\nIf the market moves in favor of the trade, the take-profit order will be filled, closing the position and locking in profits. \\nIf the market moves against the trade, the stop-loss order will be filled, closing the position and limiting losses.\\n\\nBracket orders can be created using the [OrderFactory](https://docs.nautilustrader.io/api_reference/common.html#module-nautilus_trader.common.factories) class in the Nautilus Trader API. \\nThis allows for easy and efficient creation of bracket orders, with different order types, parameters and instructions.\\n\\n```{warning}\\nYou should be aware of the margin requirements of positions, as bracketing a position will consume \\nmore order margin.\\n```\", metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\concepts\\\\advanced\\\\advanced_orders.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='# Data\\nDue to the modular nature of the Nautilus design, it is possible to set up systems \\nwith very flexible data streams, including custom user defined data types. This\\nguide covers some possible use cases for this functionality.\\n\\n## Custom/Generic Data\\nIt\\'s possible to create custom data types within the Nautilus system. First you\\nwill need to define your data by subclassing from `Data`.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.core.data import Data\\n\\n\\nclass MyDataPoint(Data):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    This is an example of a user-defined data class, inheriting from the base class `Data`.\\n\\n    The fields `label`, `x`, `y`, and `z` in this class are examples of arbitrary user data.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n    def __init__(\\n        self,\\n        label: str,\\n        x: int,\\n        y: int,\\n        z: int,\\n        ts_event: int,\\n        ts_init: int,\\n    ) -> None:\\n        self.label = label\\n        self.x = x\\n        self.y = y\\n        self.z = z\\n        self._ts_event = ts_event\\n        self._ts_init = ts_init\\n\\n    @property\\n    def ts_event(self) -> int:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        The UNIX timestamp (nanoseconds) when the data event occurred.\\n\\n        Returns\\n        -------\\n        int\\n\\n        \"\"\"\\n        return self._ts_event\\n\\n    @property\\n    def ts_init(self) -> int:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        The UNIX timestamp (nanoseconds) when the object was initialized.\\n\\n        Returns\\n        -------\\n        int\\n\\n        \"\"\"\\n        return self._ts_init\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe `Data` abstract base class acts as a contract within the system and requires two properties \\nfor all types of data: `ts_event` and `ts_init`. These represent the UNIX nanosecond timestamps \\nfor when the event occurred and when the object was initialized, respectively.\\n\\nThe recommended approach to satisfy the contract is to assign `ts_event` and `ts_init` \\nto backing fields, and then implement the `@property` for each as shown above \\n(for completeness, the docstrings are copied from the `Data` base class).\\n\\n```{note}\\nAs `Data` holds no state, it is not strictly necessary to call `super().__init__()`. \\n```\\n\\n```{note}\\nThese timestamps are what allow Nautilus to correctly order data streams for backtests \\nby monotonically increasing `ts_init` UNIX nanoseconds.\\n```\\n\\nWe can now work with this data type for backtesting and live trading. For instance,\\nwe could now create an adapter which is able to parse and create objects of this\\ntype - and send them back to the `DataEngine` for consumption by subscribers.\\n\\nYou can subscribe to these custom data types within your actor/strategy in the \\nfollowing way:\\n\\n```python\\nself.subscribe_data(\\n    data_type=DataType(MyDataPoint, metadata={\"some_optional_category\": 1}),\\n    client_id=ClientId(\"MY_ADAPTER\"),\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThis will result in your actor/strategy passing these received `MyDataPoint` \\nobjects to your `on_data` method. You will need to check the type, as this \\nmethod acts as a flexible handler for all custom/generic data.\\n\\n```python\\ndef on_data(self, data: Data) -> None:\\n    # First check the type of data\\n    if isinstance(data, MyDataPoint):\\n        # Do something with the data\\n```', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\concepts\\\\advanced\\\\data.md'}),\n",

They will also be included\\nwhen canceling all orders.\\n\\n```{note}\\nAn emulated order will retain its original client order ID throughout its entire life cycle, making it easy to query through the cache.\\n```\\n\\n## Life cycle\\nAn emulated order will progress through the following stages:\\n- Submitted by a `Strategy` through the `submit_order` method\\n- Then sent to the `RiskEngine` for pre-trade risk checks (it may be denied at this point)\\n- Then sent to the `OrderEmulator` where it is _held_ / emulated\\n\\n### Held emulated orders\\nThe following will occur for an emulated order now _held_ by the `OrderEmulator` component:\\n- The original `SubmitOrder` command will be cached\\n- The emulated order will be processed inside a local `MatchingCore` component\\n- The `OrderEmulator` will subscribe to any needed market data (if not already) to update the matching core\\n- The emulated order can be modified (by the trader) and updated (by the market) until _released_ or canceled\\n\\n### Released emulated orders\\nOnce an emulated order is triggered / matched locally based on the arrival of data, the following\\n_release_ actions will occur:\\n- The order will be transformed to either a `MARKET` or `LIMIT` order (see below table) through an additional `OrderInitialized` event\\n- The orders `emulation_trigger` will be set to `NONE` (it will no longer be treated as an emulated order by any component)\\n- The order attached to the original `SubmitOrder` command will be sent back to the `RiskEngine` for additional checks since any modification/updates\\n- If not denied, then the command will continue to the `ExecutionEngine` and on to the trading venue via an `ExecutionClient` as normal\\n\\nThe following table lists which order types are possible to emulate, and\\nwhich order type they transform to when being released for submission to the \\ntrading venue.\\n\\n## Order types\\n|                        | Can emulate | Released type |\\n|------------------------|-------------|---------------|\\n| `MARKET`               | No          | -             |\\n| `MARKET_TO_LIMIT`      | No          | -             |\\n| `LIMIT`                | Yes         | `MARKET`      |\\n| `STOP_MARKET`          | Yes         | `MARKET`      |\\n| `STOP_LIMIT`           | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |\\n| `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`    | Yes         | `MARKET`      |\\n| `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`     | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |\\n| `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET` | Yes         | `MARKET`      |\\n| `TRAILING_STOP_LIMIT`  | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |\\n\\n## Querying\\nWhen writing trading strategies, it may be necessary to know the state of emulated orders in the system.\\nIt's possible to query for emulated orders through the following `Cache` methods:\\n- `self.cache.orders_emulated(...)`\\n- `self.cache.is_order_emulated(...)`\\n- `self.cache.orders_emulated_count(...)`\\n\\nSee the full [API reference](../../api_reference/cache) for additional details.\\n\\nYou can also query order objects directly in Python:\\n- `order.is_emulated`\\n\\nOr through the C API if in Cython:\\n- `order.is_emulated_c()`\", metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\concepts\\\\advanced\\\\emulated_orders.md'}),\n",

For longer lines of code, and when passing more than a couple of arguments, you should take a new line which aligns at the next logical indent (rather than attempting a hanging 'vanity' alignment off an opening parenthesis). This practice conserves space to the right, ensures important code is more central in view, and is also robust to function/method name changes.\\n\\n2. The closing parenthesis should be located on a new line, aligned at the logical indent.\\n\\n3. Also ensure multiple hanging parameters or arguments end with a trailing comma:\\n\\n```python\\nlong_method_with_many_params(\\n    some_arg1,\\n    some_arg2,\\n    some_arg3,  # <-- trailing comma\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### PEP-8\\nThe codebase generally follows the PEP-8 style guide. Even though C typing is taken advantage of in the Cython parts of the codebase, we still aim to be idiomatic of Python where possible.\\nOne notable departure is that Python truthiness is not always taken advantage of to check if an argument is `None` for everything other than collections.\\n\\nThere are two reasons for this;\\n\\n1. Cython can generate more efficient C code from `is None` and `is not None`, rather than entering the Python runtime to check the `PyObject` truthiness.\\n\\n2. As per the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) - it’s discouraged to use truthiness to check if an argument is/is not `None`, when there is a chance an unexpected object could be passed into the function or method which will yield an unexpected truthiness evaluation (which could result in a logical error type bug).\\n\\n*“Always use if foo is None: (or is not None) to check for a None value. E.g., when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to None was set to some other value. The other value might be a value that’s false in a boolean context!”*\\n\\nHaving said all of this there are still areas of the codebase which aren’t as performance-critical where it is safe to use Python truthiness to check for `None`. \\n\\n```{note}\\nTo be clear, it's still encouraged to use Python truthiness `is` and `not` to check if collections are `None` or empty.\\n```\\n\\nWe welcome all feedback on where the codebase departs from PEP-8 for no apparent reason.\\n\\n### Docstrings\\nThe [NumPy docstring spec](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) is used throughout the codebase. This needs to be adhered to consistently to ensure the docs build correctly.\\n\\n### Flake8\\n[Flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8) is utilized to lint the codebase. Current ignores can be found in the top-level `pre-commit-config.yaml`, with the justifications also commented.\\n\\n### Commit messages\\nHere are some guidelines for the style of your commit messages:\\n\\n1. Limit subject titles to 50 characters or fewer. Capitalize subject line; use imperative voice; and do not end with period.\\n\\n2. Use 'imperative voice', i.e. the message should describe what the commit will do if applied.\\n\\n3. Optional: Use the body to explain change. Separate from subject with a blank line. Keep under 80 character width. You can use bullet points.\\n    \\n4. Optional: Provide # references to relevant issues or tickets.\\n\\n5. Optional: Provide any hyperlinks which are informative.\", metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\developer_guide\\\\coding_standards.md'}),\n",

This is because Rust will ensure that it is free of memory errors and\\ndata race conditions, being 'correct by construction' through its formal specification of types, ownership\\nand lifetimes at compile time. \\n\\nAlso, because of the lack of a built-in runtime and garbage collector, and because\\nthe language itself can access the lowest level primitives, we can expect the eventual implementations\\nto be highly performant. This combination of correctness and performance is highly valued for a HFT platform.\\n\\n## Python Binding\\nInteroperating from Python calling Rust can be achieved by binding a Rust C-ABI compatible interface generated using `cbindgen` with\\nCython. This approach is to aid a smooth transition to greater amounts\\nof Rust in the codebase, and reducing amounts of Cython (which will eventually be eliminated). \\nWe want to avoid a need for Rust to call Python using the FFI.

       " Document(page_content='# Quick Start\\n\\nThis guide explains how to get up and running with NautilusTrader backtesting with some\\nFX data. The Nautilus maintainers have pre-loaded some test data using the standard Nautilus persistence \\nformat (Parquet) for this guide.\\n\\nFor more details on how to load data into Nautilus, see [Backtest Example](../guides/backtest_example.md).\\n\\n## Running in docker\\nA self-contained dockerized jupyter notebook server is available for download, which does not require any setup or \\ninstallation. This is the fastest way to get up and running to try out Nautilus. Bear in mind that any data will be \\ndeleted when the container is deleted. \\n\\n- To get started, install docker:\\n  - Go to [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and follow the instructions \\n- From a terminal, download the latest image\\n  - `docker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:develop`\\n- Run the docker container, exposing the jupyter port: \\n  - `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:develop`\\n- Open your web browser to `localhost:{port}`\\n  - https://localhost:8888\\n\\n```{warning}\\nNautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output),\\nthis is why `log_level` in the examples is set to \"ERROR\". If you lower this level to see\\nmore logging then the notebook will hang during cell execution. A fix is currently\\nbeing investigated which involves either raising the configured rate limits for\\nJupyter, or throttling the log flushing from Nautilus.\\nhttps://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/12845\\nhttps://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-limit-output\\n```\\n\\n## Getting the sample data\\n\\nTo save time, we have prepared a script to load sample data into the Nautilus format for use with this example. \\nFirst, download and load the data by running the next cell (this should take ~ 1-2 mins):\\n\\n```bash\\n!apt-get update && apt-get install curl -y\\n!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_data/main/scripts/hist_data_to_catalog.py | python - \\n```\\n\\n## Connecting to the ParquetDataCatalog\\n\\nIf everything worked correctly, you should be able to see a single EUR/USD instrument in the catalog:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.catalog import ParquetDataCatalog\\n\\n# You can also use `ParquetDataCatalog.from_env()` which will use the `NAUTILUS_PATH` environment variable \\n# catalog = ParquetDataCatalog.from_env()\\ncatalog = ParquetDataCatalog(\"./catalog\")\\ncatalog.instruments()\\n```\\n\\n## Writing a trading strategy\\n\\nNautilusTrader includes a handful of indicators built-in, in this example we will use a MACD indicator to \\nbuild a simple trading strategy. \\n\\nYou can read more about [MACD here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp), so this \\nindicator merely serves as an example without any expected alpha. There is also a way of\\nregistering indicators to receive certain data types, however in this example we manually pass the received\\n`QuoteTick` to the indicator in the `on_quote_tick` method.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Optional\\nfrom nautilus_trader.core.message import Event\\nfrom nautilus_trader.indicators.macd import MovingAverageConvergenceDivergence\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.data import QuoteTick\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.enums import PriceType\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.enums import PositionSide\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.events import PositionOpened\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.identifiers import InstrumentId\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.objects import Quantity\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.position import Position\\nfrom nautilus_trader.trading.strategy import Strategy, StrategyConfig\\n\\n\\nclass MACDConfig(StrategyConfig):\\n    instrument_id: str\\n    fast_period: int = 12\\n    slow_period: int = 26\\n    trade_size: int = 1_000_000\\n    entry_threshold: float = 0.00010', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\getting_started\\\\quick_start.md'}),\n",

Nautilus uses a `BacktestNode` \\nto orchestrate backtest runs, which requires some setup. This may seem a little complex at first, \\nhowever this is necessary for the capabilities that Nautilus strives for.\\n\\nTo configure a `BacktestNode`, we first need to create an instance of a `BacktestRunConfig`, configuring the \\nfollowing (minimal) aspects of the backtest:\\n\\n- `engine` - The engine for the backtest representing our core system, which will also contain our strategies\\n- `venues` - The simulated venues (exchanges or brokers) available in the backtest\\n- `data` - The input data we would like to perform the backtest on', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\getting_started\\\\quick_start.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There are many more configurable features which will be described later in the docs, for now this will get us up and running.\\n\\n## Venue\\n\\nFirst, we create a venue configuration. For this example we will create a simulated FX ECN. \\nA venue needs a name which acts as an ID (in this case `SIM`), as well as some basic configuration, e.g. \\nthe account type (`CASH` vs `MARGIN`), an optional base currency, and starting balance(s).\\n\\n```{note}\\nFX trading is typically done on margin with Non-Deliverable Forward, Swap or CFD type instruments.\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import BacktestVenueConfig\\n\\nvenue = BacktestVenueConfig(\\n    name=\"SIM\",\\n    oms_type=\"NETTING\",\\n    account_type=\"MARGIN\",\\n    base_currency=\"USD\",\\n    starting_balances=[\"1_000_000 USD\"]\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Instruments\\n\\nSecond, we need to know about the instruments that we would like to load data for, we can use the `ParquetDataCatalog` for this:\\n\\n```python\\ninstruments = catalog.instruments(as_nautilus=True)\\ninstruments\\n```\\n\\n## Data\\n\\nNext, we need to configure the data for the backtest. Nautilus is built to be very flexible when it \\ncomes to loading data for backtests, however this also means some configuration is required.\\n\\nFor each tick type (and instrument), we add a `BacktestDataConfig`. In this instance we are simply \\nadding the `QuoteTick`(s) for our EUR/USD instrument:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import BacktestDataConfig\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.data import QuoteTick\\n\\ndata = BacktestDataConfig(\\n    catalog_path=str(catalog.path),\\n    data_cls=QuoteTick,\\n    instrument_id=str(instruments[0].id),\\n    end_time=\"2020-01-10\",\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Engine\\n\\nThen, we need a `BacktestEngineConfig` which represents the configuration of our core trading system.\\nHere we need to pass our trading strategies, we can also adjust the log level \\nand configure many other components (however, it\\'s also fine to use the defaults):\\n\\nStrategies are added via the `ImportableStrategyConfig`, which allows importing strategies from arbitrary files or \\nuser packages. In this instance, our `MACDStrategy` is defined in the current module, which python refers to as `__main__`.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import BacktestEngineConfig\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import ImportableStrategyConfig\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import LoggingConfig\\n\\nengine = BacktestEngineConfig(\\n    strategies=[\\n        ImportableStrategyConfig(\\n            strategy_path=\"__main__:MACDStrategy\",\\n            config_path=\"__main__:MACDConfig\",\\n            config=dict(\\n              instrument_id=instruments[0].id.value,\\n              fast_period=12,\\n              slow_period=26,\\n            ),\\n        )\\n    ],\\n    logging=LoggingConfig(log_level=\"ERROR\"),  # Lower to `INFO` to see more logging about orders, events, etc.\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Running a backtest\\n\\nWe can now pass our various config pieces to the `BacktestRunConfig`. This object now contains the \\nfull configuration for our backtest.\\n\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.config import BacktestRunConfig\\n\\n\\nconfig = BacktestRunConfig(\\n    engine=engine,\\n    venues=[venue],\\n    data=[data],\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThe `BacktestNode` class will orchestrate the backtest run. The reason for this separation between \\nconfiguration and execution is the `BacktestNode` allows running multiple configurations (different \\nparameters or batches of data). \\n\\nWe are now ready to run some backtests!\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.backtest.node import BacktestNode\\nfrom nautilus_trader.backtest.results import BacktestResult\\n\\n\\nnode = BacktestNode(configs=[config])\\n\\n # Runs one or many configs synchronously\\nresults: list[BacktestResult] = node.run()\\n```\\n\\nNow that the run is complete, we can also directly query for the `BacktestEngine`(s) used internally by the `BacktestNode`\\nby using the run configs ID. \\n\\nThe engine(s) can provide additional reports and information.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.backtest.engine import BacktestEngine\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.identifiers import Venue', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\getting_started\\\\quick_start.md'}),\n",

Simply go to https://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/ascii/tick-data-quotes/ and select an FX pair, then select one or more months of data to download.\\n\\nOnce you have downloaded the data, set the variable `DATA_DIR` below to the directory containing the data. By default, it will use the users `Downloads` directory.\\n<!-- #endregion -->\\n\\n```python\\nDATA_DIR = \"~/Downloads/\"\\n```\\n\\nRun the cell below; you should see the files that you downloaded:\\n\\n```python\\nfs = fsspec.filesystem(\\'file\\')\\nraw_files = fs.glob(f\"{DATA_DIR}/HISTDATA*\")\\nassert raw_files, f\"Unable to find any histdata files in directory {DATA_DIR}\"\\nraw_files\\n```\\n\\n## The Data Catalog\\n\\nNext we will load this raw data into the data catalog. The data catalog is a central store for Nautilus data, persisted in the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) file format.\\n\\nWe have chosen parquet as the storage format for the following reasons:\\n- It performs much better than CSV/JSON/HDF5/etc in terms of compression ratio (storage size) and read performance\\n- It does not require any separate running components (for example a database)\\n- It is quick and simple to get up and running with\\n\\n## Loading data into the catalog\\n\\nWe can load data from various sources into the data catalog using helper methods in the `nautilus_trader.persistence.external.readers` module. The module contains methods for reading various data formats (CSV, JSON, text), minimising the amount of code required to get data loaded correctly into the data catalog.\\n\\nThe FX data from `histdata` is stored in CSV/text format, with fields `timestamp, bid_price, ask_price`. To load the data into the catalog, we simply write a function that converts each row into a Nautilus object (in this case, a `QuoteTick`). For this example, we will use the `TextReader` helper, which allows reading and applying a parsing function line by line.\\n\\nThen, we simply instantiate a `ParquetDataCatalog` (passing in a directory where to store the data, by default we will just use the current directory) and pass our parsing function wrapping in the Reader class to `process_files`. We also need to know about which instrument this data is for; in this example, we will simply use one of the Nautilus test helpers to create a FX instrument.\\n\\nIt should only take a couple of minutes to load the data (depending on how many months).', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\guides\\\\backtest_example.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='# Loading External Data\\n\\nThis notebook runs through an example of loading raw data (external to Nautilus) into the NautilusTrader `ParquetDataCatalog`, for use in backtesting.\\n\\n## The DataCatalog\\n\\nThe data catalog is a central store for Nautilus data, persisted in the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) file format.\\n\\nWe have chosen parquet as the storage format for the following reasons:\\n- It performs much better than CSV/JSON/HDF5/etc in terms of compression ratio (storage size) and read performance\\n- It does not require any separately running components (for example a database)\\n- It is quick and simple to get up and running with\\n\\n### Getting some sample raw data\\n\\nBefore we start the notebook - as a once off we need to download some sample data for loading.\\n\\nFor this notebook we will use FX data from `histdata.com`, simply go to https://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/ascii/tick-data-quotes/ and select a Forex pair and one or more months of data to download.\\n\\nOnce you have downloaded the data, set the variable `input_files` below to the path containing the \\ndata. You can also use a glob to select multiple files, for example `\"~/Downloads/HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_AUDUSD_*.zip\"`.\\n\\n```python\\nimport fsspec\\nfs = fsspec.filesystem(\"file\")\\n\\ninput_files = \"~/Downloads/HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_AUDUSD_T202001.zip\"\\n```\\n\\nRun the cell below; you should see the files that you downloaded:\\n\\n```python\\n# Simple check that the file path is correct\\nassert len(fs.glob(input_files)), f\"Could not find files with {input_files=}\"\\n```\\n\\n### Loading data via Reader classes\\n\\nWe can load data from various sources into the data catalog using helper methods in the \\n`nautilus_trader.persistence.external.readers` module. The module contains methods for reading \\nvarious data formats (CSV, JSON, text), minimising the amount of code required to get data loaded \\ncorrectly into the data catalog.\\n\\nThere are a handful of readers available, some notes on when to use which:\\n- `CSVReader` - use when your data is CSV (comma separated values) and has a header row. Each row of the data typically is one \"entry\" and is linked to the header.\\n- `TextReader` - similar to CSVReader, however used when data may container multiple \\'entries\\' per line. For example, JSON data with multiple order book or trade ticks in a single line. This data typically does not have a header row, and field names come from some external definition. \\n- `ParquetReader` - for parquet files, will read chunks of the data and process similar to `CSVReader`.\\n\\nEach of the `Reader` classes takes a `line_parser` or `block_parser` function, a user defined function to convert a line or block (chunk / multiple rows) of data into Nautilus object(s) (for example `QuoteTick` or `TradeTick`).\\n\\n### Writing the parser function\\n\\nThe FX data from `histdata` is stored in CSV (plain text) format, with fields `timestamp, bid_price, ask_price`. \\n\\nFor this example, we will use the `CSVReader` class, where we need to manually pass a header (as the files do not contain one). The `CSVReader` has a couple of options, we\\'ll be setting `chunked=False` to process the data line-by-line, and `as_dataframe=False` to process the data as a string rather than DataFrame. See the [API Reference](../api_reference/persistence.md) for more details.\\n\\n```python\\nimport datetime\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.data import QuoteTick\\nfrom nautilus_trader.model.objects import Price, Quantity\\nfrom nautilus_trader.core.datetime import dt_to_unix_nanos', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\guides\\\\loading_external_data.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='def parser(data, instrument_id):\\n    \"\"\" Parser function for hist_data FX data, for use with CSV Reader \"\"\"\\n    dt = pd.Timestamp(datetime.datetime.strptime(data[\\'timestamp\\'].decode(), \"%Y%m%d %H%M%S%f\"), tz=\\'UTC\\')\\n    yield QuoteTick(\\n        instrument_id=instrument_id,\\n        bid=Price.from_str(data[\\'bid\\'].decode()),\\n        ask=Price.from_str(data[\\'ask\\'].decode()),\\n        bid_size=Quantity.from_int(100_000),\\n        ask_size=Quantity.from_int(100_000),\\n        ts_event=dt_to_unix_nanos(dt),\\n        ts_init=dt_to_unix_nanos(dt),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\n### Creating a new DataCatalog\\n\\nIf a `ParquetDataCatalog` does not already exist, we can easily create one. \\nNow that we have our parser function, we instantiate a `ParquetDataCatalog` (passing in a directory where to store the data, by default we will just use the current directory):\\n\\n```python\\nimport os, shutil\\nCATALOG_PATH = os.getcwd() + \"/catalog\"\\n\\n# Clear if it already exists, then create fresh\\nif os.path.exists(CATALOG_PATH):\\n    shutil.rmtree(CATALOG_PATH)\\nos.mkdir(CATALOG_PATH)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an instance of the ParquetDataCatalog\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.catalog import ParquetDataCatalog\\ncatalog = ParquetDataCatalog(CATALOG_PATH)\\n```\\n\\n### Instruments\\n\\nNautilus needs to link market data to an instrument ID, and an instrument ID to an `Instrument` \\ndefinition. This can be done at any time, although typically it makes sense when you are loading \\nmarket data into the catalog.\\n\\nFor our example, Nautilus contains some helpers for creating FX pairs, which we will use. If\\nhowever, you were adding data for financial or crypto markets, you would need to create (and add to \\nthe catalog) an instrument corresponding to that instrument ID. Definitions for other \\ninstruments (of various asset classes) can be found in `nautilus_trader.model.instruments`.\\n\\nSee [Instruments](../concepts/instruments.md) for more details on creating other instruments.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import process_files, write_objects\\nfrom nautilus_trader.test_kit.providers import TestInstrumentProvider\\n\\n# Use nautilus test helpers to create a EUR/USD FX instrument for our purposes\\ninstrument = TestInstrumentProvider.default_fx_ccy(\"EUR/USD\")\\n```\\n\\nWe can now add our new instrument to the `ParquetDataCatalog`:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import write_objects\\n\\nwrite_objects(catalog, [instrument])\\n```\\n\\nAnd check its existence:\\n\\n```python\\ncatalog.instruments()\\n```\\n\\n<!-- #region -->\\n### Loading the files \\n\\nOne final note: our parsing function takes an `instrument_id` argument, as in our case with \\nhist_data, however the actual file does not contain information about the instrument, only the file name \\ndoes. In our instance, we would likely need to split our loading per FX pair, so we can determine \\nwhich instrument we are loading. We will use a simple lambda function to pass our instrument ID to \\nthe parsing function.\\n\\nWe can now use the `process_files` function to load one or more files using our `Reader` class and \\n`parsing` function as shown below. This function will loop over many files, as well as breaking up \\nlarge files into chunks (protecting us from out of memory errors when reading large files) and save \\nthe results to the `ParquetDataCatalog`.\\n\\nFor the hist_data, it should take less than a minute or two to load each FX file (a progress bar \\nwill appear below):\\n<!-- #endregion -->\\n\\n```python\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import process_files\\nfrom nautilus_trader.persistence.external.readers import CSVReader\\n\\n\\nprocess_files(\\n    glob_path=input_files,\\n    reader=CSVReader(\\n        block_parser=lambda x: parser(x, instrument_id=instrument.id), \\n        header=[\\'timestamp\\', \\'bid\\', \\'ask\\', \\'volume\\'],\\n        chunked=False, \\n        as_dataframe=False,\\n    ),\\n    catalog=catalog,\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Using the ParquetDataCatalog', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\guides\\\\loading_external_data.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='## Using the ParquetDataCatalog\\n\\nOnce data has been loaded into the catalog, the `catalog` instance can be used for loading data into \\nthe backtest engine, or simple for research purposes.

See examples \\nqueries below for common use cases \\n\\nExample config: \\n\\n```python\\nconfig_node = TradingNodeConfig(\\n    data_clients={\\n        \"IB\": InteractiveBrokersDataClientConfig(\\n            instrument_provider=InteractiveBrokersInstrumentProviderConfig(\\n                load_ids={\"EUR/USD.IDEALPRO\", \"AAPL.NASDAQ\"},\\n                load_contracts={IBContract(secType=\"CONTFUT\", exchange=\"CME\", symbol=\"MES\")},\\n            )\\n    ),\\n    ...\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Examples queries\\n- Stock: `IBContract(secType=\\'STK\\', exchange=\\'SMART\\', symbol=\\'AMD\\', currency=\\'USD\\')`\\n- Stock: `IBContract(secType=\\'STK\\', exchange=\\'SMART\\', primaryExchange=\\'NASDAQ\\', symbol=\\'INTC\\')`\\n- Forex: `InstrumentId(\\'EUR/USD.IDEALPRO\\')`, `InstrumentId(\\'USD/JPY.IDEALPRO\\')`\\n- CFD: `IBContract(secType=\\'CFD\\', symbol=\\'IBUS30\\')`\\n- Future: `InstrumentId(\"YMH24.CBOT\")`, `InstrumentId(\"CLZ27.NYMEX\")`, `InstrumentId(\"ESZ27.CME\")`, `InstrumentId(\\'ES.CME\\')`, `IBContract(secType=\\'CONTFUT\\', exchange=\\'CME\\', symbol=\\'ES\\', build_futures_chain=True)`\\n- Option: `InstrumentId(\\'SPY251219C00395000.SMART\\')`, `IBContract(secType=\\'STK\\', exchange=\\'SMART\\', primaryExchange=\\'ARCA\\', symbol=\\'SPY\\', lastTradeDateOrContractMonth=\\'20251219\\', build_options_chain=True)`\\n- Bond: `IBContract(secType=\\'BOND\\', secIdType=\\'ISIN\\', secId=\\'US03076KAA60\\')`\\n- Crypto: `InstrumentId(\\'BTC/USD.PAXOS\\')`\\n\\n\\n## Configuration\\nThe most common use case is to configure a live `TradingNode` to include Interactive Brokers\\ndata and execution clients. To achieve this, add an `IB` section to your client\\nconfiguration(s) and set the environment variables to your TWS (Traders Workstation) credentials:\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\n\\nconfig = TradingNodeConfig(\\n    data_clients={\\n        \"IB\": InteractiveBrokersDataClientConfig(\\n            username=os.getenv(\"TWS_USERNAME\"),\\n            password=os.getenv(\"TWS_PASSWORD\"),\\n            ...  # Omitted\\n    },\\n    exec_clients = {\\n        \"IB\": InteractiveBrokersExecutionClientConfig(\\n            username=os.getenv(\"TWS_USERNAME\"),\\n            password=os.getenv(\"TWS_PASSWORD\"),\\n            ...  # Omitted\\n    },\\n    ...  # Omitted\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThen, create a `TradingNode` and add the client factories:\\n\\n```python\\n# Instantiate the live trading node with a configuration\\nnode = TradingNode(config=config)\\n\\n# Register the client factories with the node\\nnode.add_data_client_factory(\"IB\", InteractiveBrokersLiveDataClientFactory)\\nnode.add_exec_client_factory(\"IB\", InteractiveBrokersLiveExecClientFactory)\\n\\n# Finally build the node\\nnode.build()\\n```', metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\integrations\\\\ib.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"# Finally build the node\\nnode.build()\\n```\\n\\n### API credentials\\nThere are two options for supplying your credentials to the Interactive Brokers clients.\\nEither pass the corresponding `username` and `password` values to the config dictionaries, or\\nset the following environment variables: \\n- `TWS_USERNAME`\\n- `TWS_PASSWORD`\\n\\nWhen starting the trading node, you'll receive immediate confirmation of whether your\\ncredentials are valid and have trading permissions.\", metadata={'source': './nautilus_trader\\\\docs\\\\integrations\\\\ib.md'}),\n",

You may also want to get familiar with\\n[Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) if you don\\'t have any experience with it.\\n\\n## What is tokio-tungstenite?\\n\\nIt is based on [`tungstenite-rs`](https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs) Rust WebSocket library and provides `Tokio` bindings and wrappers for it, so you\\ncan use it with non-blocking/asynchronous `TcpStream`s from and couple it together with other crates from `Tokio` stack.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nAs with [`tungstenite-rs`](https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs) TLS is supported on all platforms using [`native-tls`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls) or [`rustls`](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) through feature flags: `native-tls`, `rustls-tls-native-roots` or `rustls-tls-webpki-roots` feature flags. Neither is enabled by default. See the `Cargo.toml` for more information. If you require support for secure WebSockets (`wss://`) enable one of them.\\n\\n## Is it performant?\\n\\nIn essence, `tokio-tungstenite` is a wrapper for `tungstenite`, so the performance is capped by the performance of `tungstenite`. `tungstenite`\\nhas a decent performance (it has been used in production for real-time communication software, video conferencing, etc), but it\\'s definitely\\nnot the fastest WebSocket library in the world at the moment of writing this note.\\n\\nIf performance is of a paramount importance for you (especially if you send **large messages**), then you might want to check other libraries\\nthat have been designed to be performant or you could file a PR against `tungstenite` to improve the performance!\\n\\nWe are aware of changes that both `tungstenite` and `tokio-tungstenite` need in order to fill the gap of ~30% performance difference between `tungstenite`\\nand more performant libraries like `fastbwebsockets`, but we have not worked on that yet as it was not required for the use case that original authors designed\\nthe library for. In the course of past years we have merged several performance improvements submitted by the awesome community of Rust users who helped to improve\\nthe library!
